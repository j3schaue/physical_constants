CODE README

The two files here were used to re-create figures 1-3 in Henrion & Fischhoff (1986). 
When these figures diverge (slightly) from H&F, this is largely due to apparent errors in their graphics.

For Larry's Methods paper, graphics for figure 1A are in the hf_speed_of_light_graphics.R file, and figures 1B and 2 are in the rec_values_graphics.R file.

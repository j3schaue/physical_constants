DATA README

Data files contain estimates recorded of physical constants and their reported uncertainties. 
Fields in each dataset vary, but most include:
* year
* method and/or author making the measurement
* estimated value
* error; often reported on the scale of a SD, unless noted as a probable error
* error_ppm; the reported standard deviation on the scale of ppm


Sources for data:

* Magnetic Moment of Proton: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), p. 115
* Gyromagntic Ratio of Proton: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), p. 90-91
* Fine Structure Constant: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
* Avogadro's Number: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), p. 136
* Absolute Ohm: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), p. 35
* Absolute Ampere: Taylor, Parker, & Langenberg (1969), p. 78
* Gravitational Constant G: Gillies (1983), p. 4-6
* Speed of Light: see data
* Recommended Values: see data


TO DO: 
Update recommended values tables for the constants in H&F 1986 through the present (or at least through 2014). A good place to start may be the review by [Olive, et al. (2014)](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/download/rpp2014-Chin.Phys.C.38.090001.pdf).

DATA README

Data files contain estimates recorded of physical constants and their reported uncertainties. 
Fields in each dataset vary, but most include:
* year
* method and/or author making the measurement
* estimated value
* error; often reported on the scale of a SD, unless noted as a probable error
* error_ppm; the reported standard deviation on the scale of ppm

README

This repository contains information on measurements of physical constants over time. 
This includes data frames of measurements for each constant, as well as a table of recommended values over the years.
It also includes code files to re-create graphics found in [Henrion & Fischhoff (1986)](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/research/Fischoff-Henrion-Assessing%20uncertainty%20in%20physical%20constants.pdf). The output of this code is in the graphcis/ folder.

Note that some of the datasets (esp. the inverse fine structure constant) are still under construction.
